# framework-zero
A lightweight RESTful web app and microservice framework for Lucee

Zero is inspired by the [Framework-one (fw/1)](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1). Zero, however seeks to provde a better experience for type checked, RESTful and domain driven applications. Zero is based on Fw/1, however diverges by removing dependency injection, changing the way controllers are executed, providing a cleaner RESTful experience out of the box, test first design, and sane default.
